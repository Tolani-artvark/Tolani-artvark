 Hi, I’m Duncan a.k.a @Tolani-artvark im a Computer Science student in my 2nd year. I'm interested in how computers work and technologies and am using this git-hub
 to explore and learn by engaging in practical projects. 
 
 These projects are from Hackathons i've partcipated in , university projects and even some ideas i've cooked up on my own.
